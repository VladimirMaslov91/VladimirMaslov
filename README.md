Why Data Analytics?
In civil engineering, I learned to work with precise data, calculations, and technical standards. However, I’m more inspired by the fast-paced digital environment, where I can see the immediate impact of my work through user behavior and product growth. Data analytics is my conscious career choice, and I’m eager to learn, grow, and contribute in this field.
